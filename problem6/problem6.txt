Question 6 (5 points):

From Question3, what issues you might obtain during the development of
the program? What issues do you think will happen if some of the actions,
e.g., waking up the ATC, checking the traffic pattern, entering the traffic
pattern, diverging to another airport, etc., take time to finish? And what
will be a potential solution for the issues? 


Answer:

An issue that could occur if actions like waking up the ATC controller, checking
the air traffic pattern, and landing all take actual time to complete are 
concurrency issues. An example would be two aircraft checking to see if the air 
traffic pattern is clear. They could see that the pattern is not full and both 
decided to land, exceeding the maximum allowed. A potential solution to this issue 
is threading and using a different thread to handle tasks like landing and managing 
air traffic patterns.
