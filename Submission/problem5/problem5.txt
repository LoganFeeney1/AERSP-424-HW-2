Question 5 (5 points):

From Question2, what issues may happen if the robot that finished the
task is assigned a new task immediately? And what will be a potential
solution for the issues?
Note: The code is optional for this question. You can submit the
discussion as a text file.


Answer:

A potential issue that could arise if a robot is immediately assigned
a task after completing one is creating the possibility of an infinite 
time loop. This would occur when the robot is endlessly assigned tasks 
due to the absence of specific ending conditions or termination criteria. 
To address this issue, there needs to be definite completion or stopping 
criteria for the program, such as a predefined number of tasks, a maximum 
duration, or other logical endpoints, to avoid infinite loops and terminate 
the program without requiring user input. there is also the issue of resource
contention meaning that if multiple robots try to use the same shared resouce
(like the tools in problem 2) and a robot is immediately assigned a task after
completing its previous task, there may be delays in the program. This can
be fixed by program design and ensuring that the program manages resource 
allocation via queueing tasks or scheduling.
